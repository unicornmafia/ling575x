(1) Goal: answer linguistic questions about languages (e.g., word order, case
      system, tense system) based on IGT data

(2) what kind of linguistic questions?
    You can choose the questions that interest you. You can use "features"
    in WALS or other questions.

(3) Approach: use enriched IGT instances to collect statistics
    (e.g., percentage of sentences with SOV order) and then answer
    the questions
         
(4) Training stage and test stage:
    You can build a statistical model or use heuristics.
    For the latter, for instance, you can collect the statistics of
     different word order (SOV, SVO, etc), and choose the most frequent one.

    In any case, you can use odin2.1 data.
    Choose the langs for which you have a lot of IGT instances and for which
     you have gold standard.


(5) Evaluation:
 * compare with gold standard in WALS (or other sources).
 * measure: accuracy etc.
